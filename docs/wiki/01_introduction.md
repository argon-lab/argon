## 🤔 Why Argon? (Motivation)

Modern data teams need to experiment, branch, and collaborate on databases just like they do with code. Traditional MongoDB deployments are monolithic, stateful, and hard to branch or time-travel. 

Argon brings **Git-style workflows to MongoDB**, enabling:
*   🚀 Rapid prototyping
*   🔬 Isolated development
*   🛡️ Safe experimentation

All this without the cost and complexity of managing full database clones! By separating compute from storage and leveraging S3 for versioned snapshots, Argon enables stateless, serverless, and cost-efficient database environments that can be branched, suspended, resumed, or restored on demand.
