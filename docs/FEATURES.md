argon branches create feature-branch --from main
argon branches merge feature-branch --into main
```

### Python SDK
```python
import argon

# Create client
client = argon.Client(api_key="your-api-key")

# Branch operations
branch = client.branches.create("experiment-1", from_branch="main")
data = client.data.get_collection("users", branch="experiment-1")
client.branches.merge("experiment-1", "main")
```

### REST API
```bash
# Authenticate
curl -X POST /api/auth/signin

# Create project
curl -X POST /api/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "ML Project", "description": "My ML experiment"}'
