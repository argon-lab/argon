# WAL Implementation Summary

## Decision Made

After deep research and analysis, we've decided to:

1. **Keep Cloud Console Simple**: Continue using collection-prefix approach for demos (budget constraints)
2. **Upgrade Open-Source to WAL**: Implement Write-Ahead Log architecture for production use cases

## 5-Week Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Foundation
- WAL service core implementation
- Dual-mode branch support (WAL + traditional)
- Feature flag system

### Week 2: Driver Integration  
- MongoDB driver wrapper
- Operation interceptors
- Backward compatibility

### Week 3: Query Engine
- Basic materialization (no caching)
- Simple filter support
- In-memory cache

### Week 4: Performance
- Parallel materialization
- Batch operations
- CLI integration

### Week 5: Testing & Rollout
- Comprehensive test suite
- Migration tools
- Documentation

## Key Simplifications

To achieve 5-week timeline:
- ❌ No snapshots (replay full WAL)
- ❌ No compression
- ❌ No Redis caching
- ❌ Complex queries
- ✅ Basic operations only
- ✅ Simple in-memory cache
- ✅ Feature flags for safety

## Architecture Approach

```go
// Parallel systems running together
if branch.UseWAL {
    // New WAL-based path
    return walEngine.Execute()
} else {
    // Existing prefix-based path
    return traditionalEngine.Execute()
}
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Performance Improvements
- Branch creation: 500ms → 10ms (50x faster)
- Storage: 10GB → 1.3GB for 10 branches (87% reduction)
- Query overhead: +50-200ms (acceptable)

### User Experience
- No breaking changes
- Gradual opt-in migration
- Full backward compatibility
- Same CLI commands

## Implementation Status

| Component | Status | Week |
|-----------|--------|------|
| WAL Core | Planned | 1 |
| Driver Wrapper | Planned | 2 |
| Query Engine | Planned | 3 |
| Performance | Planned | 4 |
| Testing | Planned | 5 |

## Files Created

1. **5-Week Plan**: `/docs/5_WEEK_WAL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
2. **Architecture Update**: `/docs/ARCHITECTURE_UPDATE.md`
3. **WAL Service**: `/internal/wal/wal_service.go`
4. **Interceptor**: `/internal/wal/interceptor.go`
5. **Branch Executor**: `/internal/wal/branch_executor.go`

## Next Steps

1. Start Week 1 implementation
2. Set up feature flags
3. Create parallel test environment
4. Begin WAL service development

## Risk Mitigation

- Keep both systems running in parallel
- Feature flags for instant rollback
- Comprehensive testing at each stage
- No forced migration

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Branch creation < 50ms
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] No breaking changes
- [ ] 80%+ storage reduction
- [ ] Smooth migration path
