# Migrating Existing MongoDB to Argon

**Current Status:** Argon is designed for new projects. Import functionality for existing databases is in development.

## üö® **Current Limitation**

Argon's WAL (Write-Ahead Log) system currently **does not support importing existing MongoDB databases**. The system is designed to track changes from the moment it's enabled.

### What This Means:
- ‚úÖ **New projects:** Full time travel and branching from day one
- ‚ùå **Existing databases:** No direct import path currently available
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Workarounds exist** but with limitations (see below)

## üõ†Ô∏è **Current Workaround Options**

### Option 1: Fresh Start (Recommended for New Features)
```bash
# Best for new microservices or features
export ENABLE_WAL=true
argon projects create new-service

# Develop your new service with full Argon capabilities
# - Time travel from day one
# - Safe branching and experimentation
# - Complete audit trail
```

### Option 2: Manual Migration (Data Only)
```bash
# Export from existing MongoDB
mongodump --uri "mongodb://localhost:27017/existing-app" --out backup/

# Create new Argon project  
export ENABLE_WAL=true
argon projects create migrated-app

# Import data (loses change history)
mongorestore --uri "your-argon-mongodb-uri" backup/existing-app/
```

**Limitations:**
- ‚ùå Loses all historical change data
- ‚ùå No time travel to pre-migration state
- ‚ùå Requires application downtime
- ‚ùå Manual process prone to errors

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Gradual Migration)
```bash
# Keep existing MongoDB for historical data
# Use Argon for new features/collections

# Existing data stays in original MongoDB
mongo existing-app

# New features use Argon
export ENABLE_WAL=true  
argon projects create new-features
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Zero risk to existing data
- ‚úÖ Gradual adoption possible
- ‚úÖ Learn Argon on non-critical features

## üöÄ **Planned Import Functionality**

We're actively developing native import capabilities:

### Phase 1: Basic Import (Next Release)
```bash
# Preview import (coming soon)
argon import preview --uri "mongodb://localhost:27017/app"
# Shows: Collections, document count, estimated WAL size

# Import existing database (coming soon)
argon import database --uri "mongodb://localhost:27017/app" --project "app"
# Creates: Initial WAL baseline from existing data
```

### Phase 2: Advanced Migration (Future)
```bash
# Live migration with minimal downtime (planned)
argon import live --uri "mongodb://localhost:27017/app" --project "app"

# Validation and rollback (planned)
argon import validate --project "app"
argon import rollback --project "app"
```

## üéØ **Adoption Strategy Recommendations**

### For Enterprise Users
1. **Start with new projects** - Get familiar with Argon's capabilities
2. **Pilot with non-critical services** - Learn the workflow safely  
3. **Plan for import tooling** - We're prioritizing this feature

### For Developers
1. **Use for new features** - Get immediate time travel benefits
2. **Experiment with staging data** - Test Argon's capabilities
3. **Provide feedback** - Help us prioritize import functionality

### For Data Scientists
1. **Perfect for new experiments** - Branch production-like data safely
2. **Use for ML pipelines** - Time travel for reproducible results
3. **Ideal for A/B testing** - Isolated experiment environments
